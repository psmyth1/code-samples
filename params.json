{"name":"Patrick Smyth's Code Samples","tagline":"","body":"### An assortment of my publicly available coding samples\r\nPlease be aware, these samples do not include any of my recent professional work.  These are a collection of old projects and other code developed on the side during personal time.  They should serve as a general reference to my coding capabilities, but in no way represent all of my skills. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8q4jQbZMnFpbDQzSW1RUnlVbmM/edit?usp=sharing) for a list of my most recent official projects.\r\n\r\nThe reason my most recent work is not available is because all of my source code developed during my time at Fidelity is considered proprietary.  If you have further questions, email me and I can share the contact info of my Fidelity supervisor.  \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPatrick Smyth\r\npsmyth1@alumni.nd.edu\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
